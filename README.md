# CS263_Performance_Comparisons

## Language Benchmarks
* pidigits :Streaming arbitrary-precision arithmetic
* binary-trees: Allocate and deallocate many many binary trees
* n-body: Double-precision N-body simulation
* reverse-complement: write DNA reverse complement
* k-nucleotide: Hashtable update and k-nucleotide strings
* sudoku: solving 20 extremely hard Sudokus repeated 50 times
* matmul: multiplying two 100x1000 matrices 
* patmch: finding lines matching a complex regexp

## Project Plan
| Week          | Description           | 
| :----: | -------------|
| Week 3 (Jan.19 ~ Jan.25)      | Implement two same algorithms: pidigits and binary-trees in Javascript, Ruby and Python. Estimate their performance in several aspects. |
| Week 4 (Jan.26 ~ Feb.1)      | Implement three same algorithms: n-body, reverse-complement and k-nucleotide. Estimate their performance in several aspects.      | 
| Week 5 (Feb.2 ~ Feb.8) | Explore and find two algorithms in cryptographic engineering and estimate their performance      |
| Week 6 (Feb.9 ~ Feb.15) | Implement Sudoku solving n different programming language. Estimate their performance.      |
| Week 7 (Feb.16 ~ Feb.22) | Implement Pattern Matching and Matrix multiplication in different programming language. Estimate their performance.    |
| Week 8 (Feb.23 ~ Mar.1) | Estimate and validate how much the use of languages we choose cost when run using different instance sizes on cloud infrastructures, e.g. AWS and Azure   |
